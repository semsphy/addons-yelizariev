Product category taxes
================================================================

The module will allow you to configure customer and vendor taxes on product categories.

* When you set the product category for your product, the taxes defined on the product category will be copied to the product.
* When you change taxes in the product category, the taxes in the products in this category will be updated. 

There is similar module "Product Category Tax" (https://github.com/akretion/odoo-usability/tree/8.0/product_category_tax), but it has GPLV-3 license. 

This module has LGPL-3 license.

Tested on `Odoo 9.0 <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/2ec9a9c99294761e56382bdcd766e90b8bc1bb38>`_
